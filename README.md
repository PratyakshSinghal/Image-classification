# Image-classification
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes steps for data preparation using OpenCV, model creation, training, and evaluation. It also incorporates TensorBoard for visualizing training metrics.
