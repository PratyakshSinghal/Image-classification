# Image-classification
This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The project includes steps for data preparation using OpenCV, model creation, training, and evaluation. It also incorporates TensorBoard for visualizing training metrics.
Self-Created Dataset: Collected images from Google, cleaned, and resized to appropriate dimensions.
Data Preparation with OpenCV: Load, preprocess, and augment images using OpenCV.
Model Architecture with Keras: Build a CNN using Keras' Sequential API, considering 13 features.
Training with TensorFlow: Train the model over 30 epochs with a TensorBoard callback to monitor performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a validation dataset.
Visualization with TensorBoard: Use TensorBoard to visualize training and validation metrics.
dataset/: Contains training and validation image directories of happy and sad faces.
